## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Organized your online orders with this application that lets you see the latest status of all your incoming packages in one platform. By keeping everything in one place, you’re less likely to forget your multiple online purchases getting stolen off your doorstep because you forgot. If you’re like me, you’re probably also sick of getting ads from retailers when the only thing you want to know is when your package has shipped. Well, this app allows you to declutter your notification feeds and stay informed on only relevant information about your shipments.
